# C(L)OBOL - a new target for Clojure :P

## COBOL has turned 60!

## Remember, LISP is the cool kid

### Punchcards

### Design by committee

### The butt of jokes

- COBOL on Wheelchair

## Why even bother?

### So many targets

Compiled:

- JVM
- CLR
- JS

Interpreted:

- Joker (go)

### The toolchain

`READER` -> `ANALYZER` -> `COMPILER`

`clojure.tools.analyzer.jvm`

## DEMO xD

## Why I'm doing it all wrong
